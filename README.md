## A Good 'IntelliSense' Function\. \(Auto\-Complete\) For TextBoxes


</div>

### Description

Like IE4 and IE5, this module when setup with your TextBoxes, will make repetitive data entries easier for your users. For example, if "hello" had been typed into the TextBox earlier, at a later date, all the user has to do is type "h" and the rest of the word will appear. Just in the style of IE4.

This stores all the keywords in a file named after the TextBox specified. It automatically adds new words to this list when the user presses Enter on the keyboard.

Even though I've uploaded it as a ZIP, it's not because it's hard, but to make it easier to understand how it's working.....
 
### More Info
 
Your TextBox name.

The completed word.

None!
